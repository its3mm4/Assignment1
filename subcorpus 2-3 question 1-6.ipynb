       "'The Hound of the Baskervilles\\n\\nby A. Conan Doyle\\n\\nChapter 1\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes\\n\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry–dignified, solid, and reassuring.\\n\\n“Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\\n\\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.\\n\\n“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.”\\n\\n“I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.”\\n\\n“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.”\\n\\n“Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”\\n\\n“I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.”\\n\\n“Why so?”\\n\\n“Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.”\\n\\n“Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.\\n\\n“And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return.”\\n\\n“Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”\\n\\nHe had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.\\n\\n“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.”\\n\\n“Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?”\\n\\n“I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”\\n\\n“Then I was right.”\\n\\n“To that extent.”\\n\\n“But that was all.”\\n\\n“No, no, my dear Watson, not all–by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”\\n\\n“You may be right.”\\n\\n“The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor.”\\n\\n“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”\\n\\n“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”\\n\\n“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.”\\n\\n“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?”\\n\\n“It certainly seems probable.”\\n\\n“Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician–little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago–the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”\\n\\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\\n\\n“As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I, “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.\\n\\n“Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon. House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’ Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of ‘Some Freaks of Atavism’ (Lancet 1882). ‘Do We Progress?’ (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”\\n\\n“No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”\\n\\n“And the dog?”\\n\\n“Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been–yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.”\\n\\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”\\n\\n“For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”\\n\\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.”\\n\\n“A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“From Charing Cross Hospital?”\\n\\n“From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”\\n\\n“Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.\\n\\nDr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. “Why was it bad?”\\n\\n“Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you say?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.”\\n\\n“Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes. “And now, Dr. James Mortimer–“\\n\\n“Mister, sir, Mister–a humble M.R.C.S.”\\n\\n“And a man of precise mind, evidently.”\\n\\n“A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not–“\\n\\n“No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”\\n\\n“Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”\\n\\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.\\n\\nHolmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume, sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?”\\n\\n“No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe–“\\n\\n“Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?” asked Holmes with some asperity.\\n\\n“To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”\\n\\n“Then had you not better consult him?”\\n\\n“I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently–“\\n\\n“Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.”\\n\\nChapter 2\\nThe Curse of the Baskervilles\\n\\n“I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.\\n\\n“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.\\n\\n“It is an old manuscript.”\\n\\n“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”\\n\\n“How can you say that, sir?”\\n\\n“You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.”\\n\\n“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast- pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him.”\\n\\nHolmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date.”\\n\\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in large, scrawling figures: “1742.”\\n\\n“It appears to be a statement of some sort.”\\n\\n“Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family.”\\n\\n“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?”\\n\\n“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.”\\n\\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\\n\\n“Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.\\n\\n“Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man. This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word through the West. It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them. At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father’s farm.\\n\\n“It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink–with other worse things, perchance–to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her. Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\\n\\n“Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to understand all that had been done in such haste. But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of wine. But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\\n\\n“They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt. And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. ‘But I have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’ So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse’s head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds. These, though known for their valour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\\n\\n“The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started. The most of them would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.\\n\\n“Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.\\n\\n“[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Elizabeth.]”\\n\\nWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.\\n\\n“Well?” said he.\\n\\n“Do you not find it interesting?”\\n\\n“To a collector of fairy tales.”\\n\\nDr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date.”\\n\\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\\n\\n“The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county. Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him. In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his gains and returned to England with them. It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death. Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end. His generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.\\n\\n“The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\\n\\n“The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person, and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion–so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him–it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s younger brother. The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.”\\n\\nDr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. “Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.”\\n\\n“I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?”\\n\\n“It does.”\\n\\n“Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\\n\\n“In doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\\n\\n“The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\\n\\n“Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart–so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.\\n\\n“I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.\\n\\n“It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\\n\\n“On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did–some little distance off, but fresh and clear.”\\n\\n“Footprints?”\\n\\n“Footprints.”\\n\\n“A man’s or a woman’s?”\\n\\nDr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\\n\\n“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”\\n\\nChapter 3\\nThe Problem\\n\\nI confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.\\n\\n“You saw this?”\\n\\n“As clearly as I see you.”\\n\\n“And you said nothing?”\\n\\n“What was the use?”\\n\\n“How was it that no one else saw it?”\\n\\n“The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend.”\\n\\n“There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?”\\n\\n“No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”\\n\\n“You say it was large?”\\n\\n“Enormous.”\\n\\n“But it had not approached the body?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“What sort of night was it?’\\n\\n“Damp and raw.”\\n\\n“But not actually raining?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“What is the alley like?”\\n\\n“There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.”\\n\\n“Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”\\n\\n“Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.”\\n\\n“I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?”\\n\\n“Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.”\\n\\n“There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.”\\n\\n“Had Sir Charles reached this?”\\n\\n“No; he lay about fifty yards from it.”\\n\\n“Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer–and this is important–the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?”\\n\\n“No marks could show on the grass.”\\n\\n“Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?”\\n\\n“Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate.”\\n\\n“You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate closed?”\\n\\n“Closed and padlocked.”\\n\\n“How high was it?”\\n\\n“About four feet high.”\\n\\n“Then anyone could have got over it?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?”\\n\\n“None in particular.”\\n\\n“Good heaven! Did no one examine?”\\n\\n“Yes, I examined, myself.”\\n\\n“And found nothing?”\\n\\n“It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes.”\\n\\n“How do you know that?”\\n\\n“Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.”\\n\\n“Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the marks?”\\n\\n“He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could discern no others.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture.\\n\\n“If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.”\\n\\n“I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so. Besides, besides–“\\n\\n“Why do you hesitate?”\\n\\n“There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless.”\\n\\n“You mean that the thing is supernatural?”\\n\\n“I did not positively say so.”\\n\\n“No, but you evidently think it.”\\n\\n“Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.”\\n\\n“For example?”\\n\\n“I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.”\\n\\n“And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?”\\n\\n“I do not know what to believe.”\\n\\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,” said he. “In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.”\\n\\n“The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well.”\\n\\n“I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and that you desire me to do it.”\\n\\n“I did not say that I desired you to do it.”\\n\\n“Then, how can I assist you?”\\n\\n“By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station”–Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch–“in exactly one hour and a quarter.”\\n\\n“He being the heir?”\\n\\n“Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles’s will.”\\n\\n“There is no other claimant, I presume?”\\n\\n“None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?”\\n\\n“Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”\\n\\n“It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.”\\n\\nHolmes considered for a little time.\\n\\n“Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville–that is your opinion?”\\n\\n“At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so.”\\n\\n“Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing.”\\n\\n“You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you recommend?”\\n\\n“I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville.”\\n\\n“And then?”\\n\\n“And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter.”\\n\\n“How long will it take you to make up your mind?”\\n\\n“Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you.”\\n\\n“I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\\n\\n“Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?”\\n\\n“Three people did.”\\n\\n“Did any see it after?”\\n\\n“I have not heard of any.”\\n\\n“Thank you. Good-morning.”\\n\\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\\n\\n“Going out, Watson?”\\n\\n“Unless I can help you.”\\n\\n“No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning.”\\n\\nI knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.\\n\\nMy first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\\n\\n“Caught cold, Watson?” said he.\\n\\n“No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”\\n\\n“I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.”\\n\\n“Thick! It is intolerable.”\\n\\n“Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.”\\n\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n“Am I right?”\\n\\n“Certainly, but how?”\\n\\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not obvious?”\\n\\n“Well, it is rather obvious.”\\n\\n“The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?”\\n\\n“A fixture also.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.”\\n\\n“In spirit?”\\n\\n“Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford’s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way about.”\\n\\n“A large-scale map, I presume?”\\n\\n“Very large.”\\n\\nHe unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the middle.”\\n\\n“With a wood round it?”\\n\\n“Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist–Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again.”\\n\\n“It must be a wild place.”\\n\\n“Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men–“\\n\\n“Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.”\\n\\n“The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer’s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”\\n\\n“What do you make of it?”\\n\\n“It is very bewildering.”\\n\\n“It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What do you make of that?”\\n\\n“Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley.”\\n\\n“He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“He was running, Watson–running desperately, running for his life, running until he burst his heart–and fell dead upon his face.”\\n\\n“Running from what?”\\n\\n“There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run.”\\n\\n“How can you say that?”\\n\\n“I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house?”\\n\\n“You think that he was waiting for someone?”\\n\\n“The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?”\\n\\n“But he went out every evening.”\\n\\n“I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning.”'"

I felt so tiny,\" said Ma Baoli, thinking back 20 years. \"I wanted to find a lover, but it was so hard.\"His corner office at Blued is decorated with pictures of near-naked men wrapped in rainbow banners, alongside official portraits of him shaking hands with top business and government officials.\\xa0It\\'s a strange mix in China.\"I want to be able to stand up and tell people that there is a guy named Geng Le in China, who is gay, living a very happy life, who even has his own adopted baby,\" said Ma, referring to the pseudonym he has used since his days writing an underground blog about gay life in the small coastal city of Qinghuangdao.Leading a double lifeBack then, he needed to hide. He said he first fell in love with a man while at the police academy in the 1990s.For years, he led a double life. Publicly, he wore a cop\\'s uniform and enforced laws that included a ban on homosexuality (which was outlawed in China until 1997), and was married to a woman. Privately, Ma ran a website popular with China\\'s stigmatized gay community, estimated to be 70 million people.This photo of Ma and his boyfriend was taken in the 1990s, when he fell in love while training at a police academy. (Submitted by Ma Baoli)Eventually, Ma could no longer sustain this elaborate ruse.\\xa0He left the police force, split from his wife, came out and\\xa0put his efforts into building Blued, which is now valued at about $600 million US. (Its better-known rival, Grindr, which has about 30 million registered users, was recently taken over by Chinese gaming company Kunlun Tech for almost $250 million.\\u200b)Blued operates mostly in China and Southeast Asia, but has plans to expand to Mexico and Brazil and eventually to North America and Europe. It\\'s also moving beyond dating to offer adoption services to gay couples and free HIV testing clinics in China.Behind the scenes, Ma uses his profile and political connections to lobby officials to improve LGBT rights and protections.Alberta judge dismisses bid to place gay-straight alliance law on holdBill to expunge gay-sex criminal records takes effect in Canada today\"We are trying to push forward the LGBT movement and change things for the better,\" said Ma. \"I think when things are as difficult as they are now, it is normal when LGBT people feel hopeless, without security.\"Indeed, Beijing\\'s approach to homosexuality has been ambiguous and sometimes contradictory.\"The government has its \\'Three No\\'s,\\'\" said Xiaogang Wei, the executive director of the LGBT group Beijing Gender. \"Don\\'t support homosexuality, don\\'t oppose and don\\'t promote.\"Last month, as Canada and many other countries celebrated Pride, China\\'s sole rainbow gathering was in Shanghai. Organizers said the government limited the event to 200 people.The \\'dark side of society\\'In 2016, Beijing banned depictions of gay people on TV and the internet in a sweeping crackdown on \"vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content.\" Regulations said any reference to homosexuality promotes the \"dark side of society,\" lumping gay content in with sexual violence and incest.A recent report by Human Rights Watch examines how Chinese parents threatened, coerced and sometimes physically forced their adolescent and adult LGBT children to submit to conversion therapy. (Kin Cheung/Associated Press)A popular Chinese drama called \"Addicted\" was immediately taken off internet streaming services because it followed two gay men through their relationships.Yet in April, when Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo decided to impose its own, apparently unofficial ban on gay content — erasing more than 50,000 posts in one day — Beijing seemed to mirror the disapproval of internet users.\\xa0\"It\\'s personal choice as to whether you approve of homosexuality or not,\" wrote the Communist Party\\'s official voice, the People\\'s Daily. \"But rationally speaking, it should be consensus that everyone should respect other people\\'s sexual orientations.\"In light of that and the online #IAmGay campaign condemning the company\\'s censorship, Weibo apologized and withdrew its ban.Still, LGBT activists say conservative social attitudes in China are just as big a problem as government restrictions.\"Traditional family values are still very prominent,\" said Wang Xu, with the LGBT group Common Language. \"There\\'s Confucian values that you have to obey your parents, and there\\'s societal norms that you have to get married by a certain age and have children and carry on the family bloodline.\" She said all of this was accentuated in the decades of China\\'s One Child policy, which put great social expectations on everyone.Verbal and physical violence by parents against gay children is not uncommon, with some parents committing their offspring to psychiatric hospitals or forcing them to undergo conversion therapy, which is widely offered.The government doesn\\'t release official statistics on any of this, but LBGT groups say family and social disapproval — especially outside large cities — means only about five per cent of gay Chinese have been ready to come out publicly.Closely regulatedIn light of this, Ma\\'s app walks a fine line. At Blued\\'s headquarters, there are several rows of workers who scan profiles, pictures and posts on the dating app in real-time, around the clock, to make sure nothing runs afoul of China\\'s regulations.The offices of Blued in Beijing have the feel of a Silicon Valley startup. (Saša Petricic/CBC)Ma said pornography is part of the government\\'s concern, but it\\'s equally worried about LGBT activism becoming an \"uncontrollable\" movement that threatens \"social stability.\"He dismisses that, but said it\\'s been challenging to get officials to understand what gay Chinese people need. On the other hand, he said if they ever do, China\\'s top-down political system means LGBT rights and social acceptance could be decreed and imposed in ways that are impossible in the West.\"In other words,\" Ma said, \"whenever the government is ready to change its approach to gay rights, the whole Chinese society will have to be ready to embrace that.\"Additional reporting by\\xa0Zhao Qian\\n\\nPlain text from https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/first-person-trans-rights-coming-out-parents-family-1.6979523:\\nThis First Person column is the experience of Alexis Zhou, a freelance writer in Montreal. For more information about CBC\\'s First Person stories, please see the FAQ.Standing among people waving trans flags and signs saying \"Leave Trans Kids Alone,\" I was on the front line of a counter protest in Montreal. Police separated us from those protesting against comprehensive sex ed and LGBTQ rights.As I scanned their faces, it looked like the \"1 million March 4 children\" protesters\\xa0came from all walks of life, spanning various ethnic and religious backgrounds, including some who looked like me. I saw concerned parents, many with their relatives by their side — aunties, uncles, grandparents. Many had their kids with them.\"Leave our kids alone,\" the parents yelled. They seemed furious with the gender ideology they see being pushed by schools. Perhaps they fear\\xa0their kids could end up like us:\\xa0trans or queer.It felt like I was looking into the faces of my own family.Alexis Zhou was reminded of her family back in China when she looked at the protesters on the other side of the police line. (Charles Contant/CBC)If they weren\\'t in China, I could picture my dad, my mom and maybe my aunties, too, handing out water bottles and handmade signs to the protesters. To my dad, being trans was either a Western conspiracy, the influence of female-dominated school staff or the contagion of social media. He couldn\\'t accept that it was coming from me. That could not be, because that would reflect poorly on him and\\xa0our\\xa0family.While there were many racialized parents in the street on that day in Montreal at the protest, there was an equal number, if not more, of racialized youth on the other side around me at the counter protest.We shouted back, \"Your kids won\\'t even talk to you when they grow up! They will look at you with shame! Children are not your possessions!\"As I joined the chants, it felt like I was shouting at my own parents. I felt all the emotions that have been held back over so many years\\xa0pour out — feeling alone while facing the turmoil of adolescence and of finding out that those I had trusted most didn\\'t really love me for who I am.I grew up in Chongqing, an inland city in China. There wasn\\'t a hint of LGBTQ programming in my schools. No visible LGBTQ presence in public, no Pride parades and gender-affirming health care was taboo.A large group of counter protesters showed up at the Montreal protest. (Charles Contant/CBC)But I was and still am trans. I stopped seeing my family as my safe place and I started navigating my transition alone at age 15. It wasn\\'t public school teachers, gender ideology, a deep state conspiracy or anything or anyone else that made me trans. I just am — a truth difficult for both my family and, for many years, for me to acknowledge.In 2018, I received a scholarship that allowed me to study in North America. In the months leading up to my departure, my parents grew increasingly suspicious of me not acting like a boy. My dad gave me talks on the danger of transgenderism and ordered me to \"man up\" my appearance.The night before my flight, they became so angry with the length of my hair that they locked me out of the house, and threatened to not allow me to go to college unless I promised to act like a man.They took me to a hairstylist that night, and since then I have not video called them over a fear of how they would react to my appearance.Across Canada, counter protesters showed their opposition to what was called the \\'1 Million March 4 Children.\\' (Charles Contant/CBC)Nearly six years later, we\\'re trying to see each other as adults — them graying, and me in my mid-20s. My dad now acknowledges that I am trans, but this comes more from a place of resignation than acceptance. It feels like all his hopes and dreams for me are gone. It\\'s a complex feeling that I\\'m still processing because I used to be the closest with my dad as a child.We talk about a family reunion, but we still don\\'t yet have a plan. I really want to hug my dad, but I\\'m also scared. I want to believe my parents love me, even though it doesn\\'t feel like it. It must be hiding somewhere deep inside.

I think about how much pain and suffering they and their kids might all be enduring.And as I work to repair the damaged relationship with my own family, I wish that these protesting parents could just listen, hug and love their children no matter who they are.I hope they don\\'t lose years of celebrations, holidays, graduation ceremonies and meals together, only to try to pick up the pieces after the damage is done.Do you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others?

(submitted by Ruby Ba)Taiwan became Asia\\'s first and only state\\xa0to legalize same-sex marriage last May.\"When we talk about democracy and freedom, it cannot just only benefit a certain part of the society and not looking at other people\\'s needs,\" Ba said.She says\\xa0given the strong conservative voices against gay marriage in Taiwan, Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party are \"courageously risking their career and ruling power to fulfil ... the LGBTQ community\\'s happiness.\"Taiwanese voters rejected same-sex marriage in a referendum on Nov. 24, 2018, while electing\\xa0candidates of the pro-China opposition Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT) to most mayoral and county magistrate posts.Simon, Ma\\'s husband, is an anthropologist at the University of Ottawa.

They…manifest the existence of immutable laws…which are revealed to be identical in all beings endowed with reason.” (Persona Humana, IV)“‘Being man’ or ‘being woman’ is a reality which is good and willed by God.”\\xa0(CCC, 369)  Gender Identity TheoryOur body has an “inbuilt order” a “grammar” that “sets forth ends and criteria for its wise use”. (Pope Benedict XVI, 48)Gender identity theory “denies the difference and reciprocity in [the] nature of a man and a woman and envisages a society with-out sexual differences” with the consequence that “human identity becomes the choice of the individual, one which can also change over time“. (Pope Francis, 56)However, “there can be no true promotion of man’s dignity unless the essential order of his nature is respected.” (Persona Humana, III)The Christian vision of anthropology sees sexuality as a fundamental component of one’s personhood and “[i]n their ‘being-man‘ and ‘being-woman,’ they reflect the Creator’s wisdom and goodness.” (CCC, 369)“There can be no true promotion of man’s dignity unless the essential order of his nature is respected.”Persona Humana, IIIThe Consequences of Transgenderism“Once the human being declares independence from reality and behaves with absolute dominion, the very foundations of our life begin to crumble”.Laudato Si, 117“Such a situation makes it increasingly difficult to grasp clearly the meaning of what man is, the meaning of his rights and his duties.”Evangelium Vitae, 11To Society  “When freedom, out of a\\xa0desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority, shuts out\\xa0even the\\xa0most obvious evidence\\xa0of an objective and universal truth…a\\xa0serious distortion of life in society” results. (Evangelium Vitae, 19-20)It is an “absurd attempt to reconstruct a solid and fruitful temporal order divorced from God, who is, in fact, the only foundation\\xa0on which it can endure.” (Mater et Magistra, 217)“When “any reference\\xa0to\\xa0common values\\xa0and to a\\xa0truth\\xa0absolutely\\xa0binding on everyone\\xa0is\\xa0lost…At that point,\\xa0everything is negotiable“. (Evangelium Vitae, 20)“Separated from God a man is but a monster, in himself and toward others; for the right ordering of human society presupposes the\\xa0right ordering\\xa0of man’s conscience with God”. (Mater et Magistra, 215)“An appreciation of our body as male or female is also necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves.” (Laudato Si, 155)To the Individual & Humanity  “[T]he\\xa0moral order\\xa0has\\xa0no existence\\xa0except in God;\\xa0cut off from God it must necessarily disintegrate.” (Mater et Magistra, 208)“[W]hen\\xa0the sense of God is lost, the sense of man is also\\xa0threatened and poisoned“. (Evangelium Vitae, 22)“[I]n his\\xa0striving\\xa0to master and\\xa0transform the world around him he is in danger of forgetting and of destroying himself.” (Mater et Magistra, 242)“[T]he\\xa0systematic violation of the moral law…produces a kind of\\xa0progressive darkening of the capacity to discern God’s living and saving presence”. (Evangelium Vitae, 21)“‘Being man’ or ‘being woman’ is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.”CCC, 369 Why is Gender Identity Such an Unacceptable View?“It is from [their] sex that the human person receives the characteristics which, on the biological, psychological and spiritual levels, make that person a man or a woman”. (Persona Humana, I)In fact, the “‘body‘ reveals the living soul” so that “[i]f we dealt with sex without the person, the whole adequacy of the anthropology which we find in Genesis would be destroyed.” (Pope St. John Paul II)“There is a deep connection between the mystery of creation, as a gift springing from love, and that beatifying ‘beginning’ of the existence of man as male and female, in the whole truth of their body and their sex“. (Pope St. John Paul II)“The acceptance of our bodies as God’s gift is vital for welcoming and accepting the entire world as a gift from the Father and our common home”. (Pope Francis, 155)Read More“Yet another sign of love will be the effort to transmit to Christians not doubts and uncertainties born of an erudition poorly assimilated but certainties that are solid because they are anchored in the Word of God. The faithful need these certainties for their Christian life; they have a right to them, as children of God who abandon themselves entirely into His arms and to the exigencies of love.\\xa0(Pope St. Paul VI, 79)The Gift of ‘Man’ and ‘Woman’“Creation is prior to us and must be received as a gift.” (Pope Francis, 56)“‘Being man’ or ‘being woman’ is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.” (CCC, 369)“It is one thing to be understanding of human weakness and the complexities of life, and another to accept ideologies that attempt to sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality.” (Pope Francis, 56)“The Church cannot remain indifferent to this confusion of minds…It is a question, in fact, of a matter which is of the utmost importance both for the personal lives of Christians and for the social life of our time.” (Persona Humana, II)“The great task is…recapturing the ultimate meaning of life and its fundamental values. Only\\xa0an awareness of the primacy of these values enables man…to\\xa0bring about the\\xa0true advancement\\xa0of the\\xa0human person\\xa0in his or her\\xa0whole truth, in his or her\\xa0freedom and dignity.” (Familiaris Consortio, 8)  What About Those Who Suffer Gender Dysphoria?“The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love”.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 25Medically  As a fairly new recognized condition (DSM V, 2013) for boys/men and girls/women who suffer gender dysphoria and/or identify as “transgender” or “nonbinary” the search for cures/solutions/treatments must be guided by models promoting the authentic good of the human person.Medical and pastoral support, as Pope Francis teaches, needs to help people “to accept their own bodies and to avoid the pretension ‘to cancel out sexual difference because one no longer knows how to deal with it.\\'” (Pope Francis, 285)“To fulfill this duty, all who collaborate in Catholic health care ministry must make every effort, using all appropriate means at their disposal, to provide the best medical care, as well as Christ’s compassionate accompaniment, to all patients, no matter who they may be or from what condition they may be suffering”. (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops)Spiritually  God made us in his image, and this image is embedded in our body as well as our soul. Our body is intrinsic to our personhood.The Church’s teaching is not meant to curtail love but to enable it. For those troubled with their identity, patience is called for. When a person is on a path seeking wholeness, their search must be encouraged and respected – in friendship.Yet for growth to be efficacious it must proceed towards the correct goal. The Church’s task is to point to the peace and life-giving path of Christ’s commandments. We owe it to God, our brothers and sisters and ourselves to offer what is true – and why we believe it is true.“Although she constantly holds up the call to perfection and asks for a fuller response to God, ‘the Church must accompany with attention and care the weakest of her children, who show signs of a wounded and troubled love, by restoring in them hope and confidence\\'”.\\xa0(Pope Francis, 291)What Can I Do?“Anyone who is Christian has a\\xa0duty\\xa0to\\xa0bear witness to the Gospel”.Pope Francis  We Must Speak out Against Transgenderism“At the same time, we are called to protect our humanity, and this means, in the first place, accepting it and respecting it as it was created.” (Pope Francis, 56)We Must Advance the Human Dignity of Male and FemaleBring also your “professional activity into conformity with the Church’s social teaching.” (Mater et Magistra, 241)“[R]ecover\\xa0an awareness of the primacy of moral values“. (Familiaris Consortio, 8)“Do nothing to compromise religion and morality.“\\xa0(Mater et Magistra, 239)“Even in the most difficult circumstances human freedom\\xa0is\\xa0capable of extraordinary acts of sacrifice and solidarity“. (Pope Benedict XVI)\\xa0We Must Practice Forbearance“Holiness in the Church begins with forbearance” (or patience). “True ‘holiness’ is not separation, but union; not judgement, but redeeming love.” Indeed, “the aspect of Christ’s holiness that upset his contemporaries was the complete absence of [a] condemnatory note”. “This does not mean that everything must be left undisturbed and endured as it is.” Indeed, the Church lives “from the struggle of the unholy to attain holiness…But this effort only becomes fruitful and constructive if it is inspired by the spirit of forbearance, by real love.”“[T]he Church raises men up, gives them a home and a hope, a home that is hope – the path to eternal life“.(All quotes are from: Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), “Introduction to Christianity”, (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2004), 342, 343, 344.]If you “take no account of those\\xa0social principles which the Church teaches\\xa0[you]\\xa0fail\\xa0in [your]\\xa0obligations\\xa0and\\xa0may easily\\xa0violate the rights of others.”Mater et Magistra, 241The Archdiocese of Baltimore has prepared a “Pastoral Accompaniment” guide for this issue.
